### Hi I am Tom ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer.
Most of my experience were built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)</a> stack, but I have played some other stack like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Hapi](https://hapi.dev/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and I love these technologies. ðŸŒ± ðŸ”­
I like solving problems and I am open minded to new technologies and always get stuff done. ðŸ˜„
